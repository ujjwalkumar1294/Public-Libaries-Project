**Public Libraries Data Analysis**

**Project Overview**

**Objective:**

The Public Libraries Data Analysis project aims to analyze the distribution, accessibility, and performance of public libraries using data-driven insights. Understanding public libraries' availability and usage patterns can help policymakers, educators, and researchers enhance literacy programs and optimize resource allocation.

**Goals:**

Analyze trends in public libraries' locations, services, and accessibility.

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract key insights.

Develop interactive visualizations to showcase findings.

Implement predictive analytics to identify trends in library usage and resource allocation.

Provide recommendations for improving library accessibility and resource distribution.

**Expected Outcomes:**

A comprehensive dataset cleaned and structured for analysis.

Key insights into public libraries' demographics, services, and locations.

Graphical representations of trends, distributions, and correlations.

Statistical and predictive models for future library service improvements.

A well-documented report summarizing findings and recommendations.

**Scope:**

Focus on public libraries and their accessibility across regions.

Analysis of library attributes such as location, population served, funding, and services offered.

Data visualization and statistical interpretation.

Applicable to research, policy planning, and public service improvements.
